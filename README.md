# challenge-4-codequiz

## Description

Code Quiz:

1) Quiz starts when start button is pressed
2) Timer starts at 75 seconds and counts down 
3) Selecting an answer loads the next question, wrong answers takes 10 seconds off the timer.
4) Game is over when all questions are answered or timer = 0.
5) Score history is saved with user initials

NOTES:

1) Originally had answer choices as buttons but changed to list items because of difficulties with html/flexbox
2) Originally tried to have 'high score'and 'game over/user name input' screen as seperate 'popup' screen on same webpage, but could not get this to work, so made each of these a seperate webpage.
